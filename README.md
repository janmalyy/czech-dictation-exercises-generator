# czech-dictation-exercises-generator
Abstract:

The bachelor thesis explores the possibilities of automatic generation of dictation exercises for Czech. The aim is to find the most plausible solution and implement it. The chosen solution is the combination of a manually crafted database of phrases, a generative pretrained transformer and prompt engineering. The outcome of the thesis is a web page, where the user chooses the dictation exercise parameters and is given back some dictation exercises concerning the desired parameters. The parameters are following: the orthography phenomenon to be practised and the difficulty and length of the text. The web page could facilitate and speed up the process of dictation exercises creation for Czech lessons. The evaluation of the web page made by teachers is included.


Keywords:
